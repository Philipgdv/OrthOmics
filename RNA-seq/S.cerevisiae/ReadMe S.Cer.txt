This is a short list of things to consider when analysing the S.cerevisiae data in this box folder. This is not exhaustive, and only applies to the RNA-seq.

Initial PCA analysis suggested two samples in the experiment may have been switched (either in preparation, or durign barcoding), since one control clustered well with low pH and vice versa. Therefore, these samples were re-sequenced and checked again. This analysis confirmed that the samples had been switched somewhere in the downstream processing. Thus, these samples are switched in the R-script. Following the script as it is currently wirtten will rectify all errors.
