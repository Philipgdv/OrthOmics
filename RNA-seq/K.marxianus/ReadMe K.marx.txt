This is a short list of things to consider when analysing the K.marxianus data in this box folder. This is not exhaustive, and only applies to the RNA-seq.

1) One of the high temperature samples gave low quality sequencing for K.marx.
2) I re-prepared and re-sequenced this sample, and got a similar result with low quality sequencing. Therefore, this sample is excluded from the analysis. The script included removes both the original low quality sample and the rerun sample.

Further questions/comments can be send to doughty@chalmers.se.

Please do not distribute this data outside of CHASSY until it is published.
