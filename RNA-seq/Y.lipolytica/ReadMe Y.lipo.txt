This is a short list of things to consider when analysing the Y.lipolytica data in this box folder. This is not exhaustive, and only applies to the RNA-seq.

This readme file is a place holder, the Y.lipo data did not have any issues.

Further questions/comments can be send to doughty@chalmers.se.

Please do not distribute this data outside of CHASSY until it is published.
