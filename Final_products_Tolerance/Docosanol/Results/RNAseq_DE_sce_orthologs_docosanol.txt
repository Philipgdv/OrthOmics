Upon entry of the heterotrimeric SRP1-KAP95-cargo complex in the nucleus, NUP2 binds through its N-terminus to the SRP1 nuclear localization signal (NLS) binding site, thus accelerating the release of the NLS-cargo.

Heterodimerizes with MSH2 to form MutS beta, which binds to DNA mismatches thereby initiating DNA repair. MSH3 provides substrate-binding and substrate specificity to the complex. When bound, the MutS beta heterodimer bends the DNA helix and shields approximately 20 base pairs. Acts mainly to repair insertion-deletion loops (IDLs) from 2 to 13 nucleotides in size, but can also repair base-base and single insertion-deletion mismatches that occur during replication. After mismatch binding, forms a ternary complex with either the MutL alpha or MutL beta heterodimer, which is thought to be responsible for directing the downstream MMR events, including strand discrimination, excision, and resynthesis. MutS beta also has a role in regulation of heteroduplex formation during mitotic and meiotic recombination. MutS beta binds to DNA flap structures predicted to form during recombination, and is required for 3' non-homologous tail removal (NHTR). MutS beta-binding alters the DNA conformation of its substrate at the ds/ssDNA junction and may facilitate its recognition and/or cleavage by the downstream nucleotide excision repair (NER) RAD1-RAD10 endonuclease.

In a second step, the cluster is released from ISU1/ISU2, transferred to glutaredoxin GRX5, followed by the formation of mitochondrial [2Fe-2S] proteins, the synthesis of [4Fe-4S] clusters and their target-specific insertion into the recipient apoproteins. Cluster assembly on ISU1/ISU2 depends on the function of the cysteine desulfurase complex NFS1-ISD11, which serves as the sulfur donor for cluster synthesis, the iron-binding protein frataxin (YFH1) as the putative iron donor, and the electron transfer chain comprised of ferredoxin reductase ARH1 and ferredoxin YAH1, which receive their electrons from NADH. Fe-S cluster release from ISU1/ISU2 is achieved by interaction with the Hsp70 chaperone SSQ1, assisted by the DnaJ-like co-chaperone JAC1 and the nucleotide exchange factor MGE1.

KSS1 activity is down-regulated by FUS3 during pheromone induction to prevent inappropriate activation of the filamentation pathway. During induction of filamentation, KSS1 activates the transcription factor STE12 resulting in its binding to and activation of filamentation specific genes. Non-activated KSS1 has a kinase-independent repressive effect on STE12 transcriptional activity, that is mediated by direct binding to STE12 and depends on the presence of DIG1 and DIG2, and that is required for the suppression of filamentation under normal growth conditions. SSN3/SRB10 contributes further to the suppression of filamentation under these conditions by reducing STE12 stability independent of KSS1.

TORC1 regulates multiple cellular processes to control cell growth in response to environmental signals. Nutrient limitation and environmental stress signals cause inactivation of TORC1. Active TORC1 positively controls ribosome biogenesis via control of rRNA, ribosomal protein and tRNA gene expression, and rRNA processing. TORC1 positively controls protein biosynthesis by regulation of mRNA stability, translation initiation factor activity, and high-affinity amino acid permeases that serve to provide amino acids for use by the translation machinery. TORC1 also promotes growth by sequestering a number of nutrient and general stress-responsive transcription factors in the cytoplasm. TORC1 negatively controls macroautophagy, a process to recycle surplus cytoplasmic mass under nutrient starvation conditions. TORC1 controls many of these processes via TIP41-TAP42-mediated inhibition of the type 2A-related phosphatases PP2A and SIT4 (PubMed:10198052, PubMed:10329624, PubMed:10604478, PubMed:11741537, PubMed:15620355, PubMed:7606777, PubMed:8741837, PubMed:9539725, PubMed:9843498). In nutrient rich conditions, responsible for the phosphorylation of AGC S6 kinase (S6K) YPK3, activating YPK3 kinase activity and promoting phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6 (PubMed:25767889). Phosphorylates kinase SCH9 at 6 amino acids in the C-terminus, activating SCH9 kinase activity to properly regulate ribosome biogenesis, translation initiation, and entry into stationary phase (PubMed:17560372). TORC2 regulates cell cycle-dependent polarization of the actin-cytoskeleton, cell wall integrity, and receptor endocytosis. TORC2 controls polarity of the actin cytoskeleton, which is required for orienting the secretory pathway toward discrete growth sites, via the RHO1/PKC1/MAPK cell integrity pathway by activating the RHO1 guanine nucleotide exchange factor ROM2. TORC2 phosphorylates the AGC kinase YPK2, an upstream effector of the cell integrity pathway. TORC2 negatively regulates calcineurin-dependent stress signaling via phosphorylation of its effector SLM1-SLM2 (PubMed:14593073, PubMed:15372071, PubMed:16055732, PubMed:16959779, PubMed:8846782, PubMed:8943012). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10198052, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10329624, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10604478, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11741537, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14593073, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15372071, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15620355, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16055732, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16959779, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17560372, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25767889, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7606777, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8741837, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8846782, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8943012, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9539725, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9843498}."

Nutrient limitation and environmental stress signals cause inactivation of TORC1. Active TORC1 positively controls ribosome biogenesis via control of rRNA, ribosomal protein and tRNA gene expression, and rRNA processing. TORC1 positively controls protein biosynthesis by regulation of mRNA stability, translation initiation factor activity, and high-affinity amino acid permeases that serve to provide amino acids for use by the translation machinery. TORC1 also promotes growth by sequestering a number of nutrient and general stress-responsive transcription factors in the cytoplasm. TORC1 negatively controls macroautophagy, a process to recycle surplus cytoplasmic mass under nutrient starvation conditions. TORC1 controls many of these processes via TIP41-TAP42-mediated inhibition of the type 2A-related phosphatases PP2A and SIT4 (PubMed:10198052, PubMed:10329624, PubMed:10604478, PubMed:10995454, PubMed:11741537, PubMed:15620355, PubMed:7606777, PubMed:8741837, PubMed:9539725, PubMed:9843498).
