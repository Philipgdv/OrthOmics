When covalently bound, it is conjugated to target proteins via an isopeptide bond either as a monomer (monoubiquitin), a polymer linked via different Lys residues of the ubiquitin (polyubiquitin chains) or a linear polymer linked via the initiator Met of the ubiquitin (linear polyubiquitin chains). Polyubiquitin chains, when attached to a target protein, have different functions depending on the Lys residue of the ubiquitin that is linked: Lys-6-linked may be involved in DNA repair; Lys-11-linked is involved in ERAD (endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation) and in cell-cycle regulation; Lys-29-linked is involved in lysosomal degradation; Lys-33-linked is involved in kinase modification; Lys-48-linked is involved in protein degradation via the proteasome; Lys-63-linked is involved in endocytosis, and DNA-damage responses. Linear polymer chains formed via attachment by the initiator Met lead to cell signaling. Ubiquitin is usually conjugated to Lys residues of target proteins, however, in rare cases, conjugation to Cys or Ser residues has been observed.

Polyubiquitin chains, when attached to a target protein, have different functions depending on the Lys residue of the ubiquitin that is linked: Lys-6-linked may be involved in DNA repair; Lys-11-linked is involved in ERAD (endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation) and in cell-cycle regulation; Lys-29-linked is involved in lysosomal degradation; Lys-33-linked is involved in kinase modification; Lys-48-linked is involved in protein degradation via the proteasome; Lys-63-linked is involved in endocytosis, and DNA-damage responses. Linear polymer chains formed via attachment by the initiator Met lead to cell signaling. Ubiquitin is usually conjugated to Lys residues of target proteins, however, in rare cases, conjugation to Cys or Ser residues has been observed.

Here the enzyme catalyzes the decarboxylation of amino acids, which, in a first step, have been transaminated to the corresponding 2-oxo acids. In a third step, the resulting aldehydes are reduced to alcohols, collectively referred to as fusel oils or alcohols. Its preferred substrates are the transaminated amino acids derived from threonine (2-oxobutanoate), norvaline (2-oxopentanoate), valine (3-methyl-2-oxobutanoate, also alpha-keto-isovalerate), isoleucine ((3S)-3-methyl-2-oxopentanoate, also alpha-keto-beta-methylvalerate), phenylalanine (phenylpyruvate), and tryptophan (3-(indol-3-yl)pyruvate), whereas transaminated leucine is no substrate.

Stimulates folding by interacting with nascent chains, binding to short, largely hydrophobic sequences exposed by unfolded proteins, thereby stabilizing longer, more slowly translated, and aggregation-prone nascent polypeptides and domains that cannot fold stably until fully synthesized. The Hsp70-protein substrate interaction depends on ATP-binding and on allosteric regulation between the NBD and the SBD. The ATP-bound state is characterized by a fast exchange rate of substrate (low affinity state), while in the ADP-bound state exchange is much slower (high affinity state). During the Hsp70 cycle, the chaperone switches between the ATP-bound state (open conformation) and the ADP-bound state (closed conformation) by major conformational rearrangements involving mainly the lid domain. Ssb cooperates with a specific Hsp40/Hsp70 co-chaperone termed the ribosome-associated complex (RAC), which stimulates the ATPase activity of the ribosome-associated pool of Ssbs and switches it to the high affinity substrate binding state.

The polymerase activity is proposed to involve a tethering mechanism at the microtubule plus end: a curved, longitudinally microtubule lattice-associated tubulin heterodimer (that cannot be incorporated into the microtubule lattice) is bound via one TOG domain while the other TOG domain binds to an unpolymerized tubulin heterodimer leading to lateral association of these tubulin heterdimers; polymerization-induced straightening of the tubulin heterodimer releases the polymerase (PubMed:11309422, PubMed:25172511, PubMed:16567500, PubMed:25097237).

It recognizes H3K4me. SAGA is involved in RNA polymerase II-dependent transcriptional regulation of approximately 10% of yeast genes. At the promoters, SAGA is required for recruitment of the basal transcription machinery. It influences RNA polymerase II transcriptional activity through different activities such as TBP interaction (SPT3, SPT8 and SPT20) and promoter selectivity, interaction with transcription activators (GCN5, ADA2, ADA3 and TRA1), and chromatin modification through histone acetylation (GCN5) and deubiquitination (UBP8). SAGA acetylates nucleosomal histone H3 to some extent (to form H3K9ac, H3K14ac, H3K18ac and H3K23ac). SAGA interacts with DNA via upstream activating sequences (UASs). SLIK is proposed to have partly overlapping functions with SAGA. It preferentially acetylates methylated histone H3, at least after activation at the GAL1-10 locus. Acts in opposition to the FACT complex in regulating polymerase II transcription. Also required for efficient transcription by RNA polymerase I, and more specifically the pol I transcription termination step. Regulates negatively DNA replication.

Stimulates folding by interacting with nascent chains, binding to short, largely hydrophobic sequences exposed by unfolded proteins, thereby stabilizing longer, more slowly translated, and aggregation-prone nascent polypeptides and domains that cannot fold stably until fully synthesized. The Hsp70-protein substrate interaction depends on ATP-binding and on allosteric regulation between the NBD and the SBD. The ATP-bound state is characterized by a fast exchange rate of substrate (low affinity state), while in the ADP-bound state exchange is much slower (high affinity state). During the Hsp70 cycle, the chaperone switches between the ATP-bound state (open conformation) and the ADP-bound state (closed conformation) by major conformational rearrangements involving mainly the lid domain. Ssb cooperates with a specific Hsp40/Hsp70 co-chaperone termed the ribosome-associated complex (RAC), which stimulates the ATPase activity of the ribosome-associated pool of Ssbs and switches it to the high affinity substrate binding state.

Phosphorylated KSS1 activates both pathways, whereas activated FUS3 activates the mating but suppresses the filamentation pathway. KSS1 activity is down-regulated by FUS3 during pheromone induction to prevent inappropriate activation of the filamentation pathway. During induction of filamentation, KSS1 activates the transcription factor STE12 resulting in its binding to and activation of filamentation specific genes. Non-activated KSS1 has a kinase-independent repressive effect on STE12 transcriptional activity, that is mediated by direct binding to STE12 and depends on the presence of DIG1 and DIG2, and that is required for the suppression of filamentation under normal growth conditions. SSN3/SRB10 contributes further to the suppression of filamentation under these conditions by reducing STE12 stability independent of KSS1. FUS3 can partially compensate for the lack of KSS1 but filamentation becomes constitutively induced at a low level in the absence of any signal.

TORC1 regulates multiple cellular processes to control cell growth in response to environmental signals. Nutrient limitation and environmental stress signals cause inactivation of TORC1. Active TORC1 positively controls ribosome biogenesis via control of rRNA, ribosomal protein and tRNA gene expression, and rRNA processing. TORC1 positively controls protein biosynthesis by regulation of mRNA stability, translation initiation factor activity, and high-affinity amino acid permeases that serve to provide amino acids for use by the translation machinery. TORC1 also promotes growth by sequestering a number of nutrient and general stress-responsive transcription factors in the cytoplasm. TORC1 negatively controls macroautophagy, a process to recycle surplus cytoplasmic mass under nutrient starvation conditions. TORC1 controls many of these processes via TIP41-TAP42-mediated inhibition of the type 2A-related phosphatases PP2A and SIT4 (PubMed:10198052, PubMed:10329624, PubMed:10604478, PubMed:11741537, PubMed:15620355, PubMed:7606777, PubMed:8741837, PubMed:9539725, PubMed:9843498). In nutrient rich conditions, responsible for the phosphorylation of AGC S6 kinase (S6K) YPK3, activating YPK3 kinase activity and promoting phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6 (PubMed:25767889). Phosphorylates kinase SCH9 at 6 amino acids in the C-terminus, activating SCH9 kinase activity to properly regulate ribosome biogenesis, translation initiation, and entry into stationary phase (PubMed:17560372). TORC2 regulates cell cycle-dependent polarization of the actin-cytoskeleton, cell wall integrity, and receptor endocytosis. TORC2 controls polarity of the actin cytoskeleton, which is required for orienting the secretory pathway toward discrete growth sites, via the RHO1/PKC1/MAPK cell integrity pathway by activating the RHO1 guanine nucleotide exchange factor ROM2. TORC2 phosphorylates the AGC kinase YPK2, an upstream effector of the cell integrity pathway. TORC2 negatively regulates calcineurin-dependent stress signaling via phosphorylation of its effector SLM1-SLM2 (PubMed:14593073, PubMed:15372071, PubMed:16055732, PubMed:16959779, PubMed:8846782, PubMed:8943012). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10198052, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10329624, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10604478, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11741537, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14593073, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15372071, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15620355, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16055732, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16959779, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17560372, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25767889, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7606777, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8741837, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8846782, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8943012, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9539725, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9843498}."

At the promoters, SAGA is required for recruitment of the basal transcription machinery. It influences RNA polymerase II transcriptional activity through different activities such as TBP interaction (SPT3, SPT8 and SPT20) and promoter selectivity, interaction with transcription activators (GCN5, ADA2, ADA3 and TRA1), and chromatin modification through histone acetylation (GCN5) and deubiquitination (UBP8).

Largest and catalytic component of RNA polymerase II which synthesizes mRNA precursors and many functional non-coding RNAs. Forms the polymerase active center together with the second largest subunit. Pol II is the central component of the basal RNA polymerase II transcription machinery. During a transcription cycle, Pol II, general transcription factors and the Mediator complex assemble as the preinitiation complex (PIC) at the promoter. 11-15 base pairs of DNA surrounding the transcription start site are melted and the single-stranded DNA template strand of the promoter is positioned deeply within the central active site cleft of Pol II to form the open complex. After synthesis of about 30 bases of RNA, Pol II releases its contacts with the core promoter and the rest of the transcription machinery (promoter clearance) and enters the stage of transcription elongation in which it moves on the template as the transcript elongates. Pol II appears to oscillate between inactive and active conformations at each step of nucleotide addition. Elongation is influenced by the phosphorylation status of the C-terminal domain (CTD) of Pol II largest subunit (RPB1), which serves as a platform for assembly of factors that regulate transcription initiation, elongation, termination and mRNA processing. Pol II is composed of mobile elements that move relative to each other. The core element with the central large cleft comprises RPB3, RBP10, RPB11, RPB12 and regions of RPB1 and RPB2 forming the active center. The clamp element (portions of RPB1, RPB2 and RPB3) is connected to the core through a set of flexible switches and moves to open and close the cleft. A bridging helix emanates from RPB1 and crosses the cleft near the catalytic site and is thought to promote translocation of Pol II by acting as a ratchet that moves the RNA-DNA hybrid through the active site by switching from straight to bent conformations at each step of nucleotide addition. In elongating Pol II, the lid loop (RPB1) appears to act as a wedge to drive apart the DNA and RNA strands at the upstream end of the transcription bubble and guide the RNA strand toward the RNA exit groove located near the base of the largely unstructured CTD domain of RPB1. The rudder loop (RPB1) interacts with single-stranded DNA after separation from the RNA strand, likely preventing reassociation with the exiting RNA. The cleft is surrounded by jaws: an upper jaw formed by portions of RBP1, RPB2 and RPB9, and a lower jaw, formed by RPB5 and portions of RBP1. The jaws are thought to grab the incoming DNA template, mainly by RPB5 direct contacts to DNA."

Mediates docking of the importin/substrate complex to the nuclear pore complex (NPC) through binding to repeat-containing nucleoporins. The complex is subsequently translocated through the pore by an energy requiring, Ran-dependent mechanism (PubMed:11423015). At the nucleoplasmic side of the NPC, GTP-Ran binding leads to release of the cargo (PubMed:9321403). The importin is re-exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm where GTP hydrolysis releases Ran from importin.

First, a [2Fe-2S] cluster is transiently assembled on the scaffold proteins ISU1 and ISU2. In a second step, the cluster is released from ISU1/ISU2, transferred to glutaredoxin GRX5, followed by the formation of mitochondrial [2Fe-2S] proteins, the synthesis of [4Fe-4S] clusters and their target-specific insertion into the recipient apoproteins. Cluster assembly on ISU1/ISU2 depends on the function of the cysteine desulfurase complex NFS1-ISD11, which serves as the sulfur donor for cluster synthesis, the iron-binding protein frataxin (YFH1) as the putative iron donor, and the electron transfer chain comprised of ferredoxin reductase ARH1 and ferredoxin YAH1, which receive their electrons from NADH. Fe-S cluster release from ISU1/ISU2 is achieved by interaction with the Hsp70 chaperone SSQ1, assisted by the DnaJ-like co-chaperone JAC1 and the nucleotide exchange factor MGE1.

In the SAGA complex, SGF29 specifically recognizes and binds methylated 'Lys-4' of histone H3 (H3K4me), with a preference for trimethylated form (H3K4me3) (PubMed:21685874). SGF29 is also required for heterochromatin boundary formation function (PubMed:24307402). SAGA is involved in RNA polymerase II-dependent transcriptional regulation of approximately 10% of yeast genes At the promoters, SAGA is required for recruitment of the basal transcription machinery (PubMed:10026213). It influences RNA polymerase II transcriptional activity through different activities such as TBP interaction (SPT3, SPT8 and SPT20) and promoter selectivity, interaction with transcription activators (GCN5, ADA2, ADA3 and TRA1), and chromatin modification through histone acetylation (GCN5) and deubiquitination (UBP8) (PubMed:10026213). SAGA acetylates nucleosomal histone H3 to some extent (to form H3K9ac, H3K14ac, H3K18ac and H3K23ac). SAGA interacts with DNA via upstream activating sequences (UASs) (PubMed:10026213).

Acts in concert with a poly(A)-specific nuclease (PAN) to affect poly(A) tail shortening, which may occur concomitantly with either nucleocytoplasmic mRNA transport or translational initiation. Regulates PAN activity via interaction with the stimulator PAN3 or the inhibitor PBP1. In the cytoplasm, affects both translation and mRNA decay. Stimulates translation by interaction with translation initiation factor eIF4G, a subunit of the cap-binding complex eIF4F, bringing the 5'- and 3'-ends of the mRNA in proximity. The formation of this circular mRNP structure appears to be critical for the synergistic effects of the cap and the poly(A) tail in facilitating translation initiation, recycling of ribosomes, and mRNA stability.

Upon vesicle tethering to the target membrane, which requires additional proteins, a SNARE-pin is formed. This is a very stable 4 parallel alpha-helical coil bundle consisting of 4 SNARE domains (usually one of each type: Qa, Qb, Qc, and R), of which at least one is anchored in the opposite membrane. The formation of the SNARE-pin is believed to bring the two membranes in close proximity and to provide the energy to drive membrane fusion. Through its interaction with the VFT (or GARP) complex, it may also contribute to vesicle recognition specificity and tethering.

Heterodimerizes with MSH2 to form MutS alpha, which binds to DNA mismatches thereby initiating DNA repair. MSH6 provides substrate-binding and substrate specificity to the complex. When bound, MutS alpha bends the DNA helix and shields approximately 20 base pairs. Acts mainly to repair base-base and single insertion-deletion mismatches that occur during replication, but can also repair longer insertion-deletion loops (IDLs), although with decreasing efficiency as the size of the extrahelical loop increases. After mismatch binding, forms a ternary complex with the MutL alpha heterodimer, which is thought to be responsible for directing the downstream MMR events, including strand discrimination, excision, and resynthesis. ATP binding and hydrolysis by the MutS alpha complex is crucial for MMR. Both subunits bind ATP, but with differing affinities, and their ATPase kinetics are also very different. MSH6 binds and hydrolyzes ATP rapidly, whereas MSH2 catalyzes ATP at a substantially slower rate. Binding to a mismatched base pair suppresses MSH6-catalyzed ATP hydrolysis, but not the activity of MSH2. ATP binding to both subunits is necessary to trigger a change in MutS alpha interaction with mismatched DNA, converting MutS alpha into a sliding clamp capable of hydrolysis-independent movement along DNA, and also facilitates formation of ternary complexes containing MutS and MutL proteins and the mismatch. May also be involved in resolution of recombination intermediates. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10518225, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10970737, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11237611, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12509278, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12820877, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15811858, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16214425, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16337600, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16407100, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16600868, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16702432, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17141577, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17157869, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17567610, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17573527, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8600025, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9111357, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9545323, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9770499}."

Forms two different heterodimers: MutS alpha (MSH2-MSH6 heterodimer) and MutS beta (MSH2-MSH3 heterodimer), which bind to DNA mismatches thereby initiating DNA repair. MSH2 seems to act as a scaffold for the other MutS homologs that provide substrate-binding and substrate specificity. When bound, heterodimers bend the DNA helix and shield approximately 20 base pairs. MutS alpha acts mainly to repair base-base and single insertion-deletion mismatches that occur during replication, but can also repair longer insertion-deletion loops (IDLs), although with decreasing efficiency as the size of the extrahelical loop increases. MutS beta acts mainly to repair IDLs from 2 to 13 nucleotides in size, but can also repair base-base and single insertion-deletion mismatches. After mismatch binding, MutS alpha or beta form a ternary complex with a MutL heterodimer, which is thought to be responsible for directing the downstream MMR events, including strand discrimination, excision, and resynthesis. ATP binding and hydrolysis play a pivotal role in mismatch repair functions. Both subunits bind ATP, but with differing affinities, and their ATPase kinetics are also very different. MSH6 binds and hydrolyzes ATP rapidly, whereas MSH2 catalyzes ATP at a substantially slower rate. Binding to a mismatched base pair suppresses MSH6-catalyzed ATP hydrolysis, but not the activity of MSH2. ATP binding to both subunits is necessary to trigger a change in MutS alpha interaction with mismatched DNA, converting MutS alpha into a sliding clamp capable of hydrolysis-independent movement along DNA, and also facilitates formation of ternary complexes containing MutS and MutL proteins and the mismatch. MutS beta also has a role in regulation of heteroduplex formation during mitotic and meiotic recombination. MutS beta binds to DNA flap structures predicted to form during recombination, and is required for 3' non-homologous tail removal (NHTR). MutS beta-binding alters the DNA conformation of its substrate at the ds/ssDNA junction and may facilitate its recognition and/or cleavage by the downstream nucleotide excision repair (NER) RAD1-RAD10 endonuclease. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10518225, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11237611, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12509278, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12820877, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12875840, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15811858, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16214425, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16337600, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16600868, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16702432, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16781730, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17157869, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17636021, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8600025, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9111357, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9256462, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9368761, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9545323, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9770499}."

Second largest component of RNA polymerases II which synthesizes mRNA precursors and many functional non-coding RNAs. Proposed to contribute to the polymerase catalytic activity and forms the polymerase active center together with the largest subunit. Pol II is the central component of the basal RNA polymerase II transcription machinery. During a transcription cycle, Pol II, general transcription factors and the Mediator complex assemble as the preinitiation complex (PIC) at the promoter. 11-15 base pairs of DNA surrounding the transcription start site are melted and the single-stranded DNA template strand of the promoter is positioned deeply within the central active site cleft of Pol II to form the open complex. After synthesis of about 30 bases of RNA, Pol II releases its contacts with the core promoter and the rest of the transcription machinery (promoter clearance) and enters the stage of transcription elongation in which it moves on the template as the transcript elongates. Pol II appears to oscillate between inactive and active conformations at each step of nucleotide addition. Pol II is composed of mobile elements that move relative to each other. The core element with the central large cleft comprises RPB3, RBP10, RPB11, RPB12 and regions of RPB1 and RPB2 forming the active center. The clamp element (portions of RPB1, RPB2 and RPB3) is connected to the core through a set of flexible switches and moves to open and close the cleft. The cleft is surrounded by jaws: an upper jaw formed by portions of RBP1, RPB2 and RPB9, and a lower jaw. The jaws are thought to grab the incoming DNA template. The fork loop 1 (RPB2) interacts with the RNA-DNA hybrid, possibly stabilizing it."

SAGA is involved in RNA polymerase II-dependent transcriptional regulation of approximately 10% of yeast genes.

It influences RNA polymerase II transcriptional activity through different activities such as TBP interaction (SPT3, SPT8 and SPT20) and promoter selectivity, interaction with transcription activators (GCN5, ADA2, ADA3 and TRA1), and chromatin modification through histone acetylation (GCN5) and deubiquitination (UBP8).

Binding of TFIID to a promoter (with or without TATA element) is the initial step in preinitiation complex (PIC) formation (PubMed:10788514, PubMed:12138208, PubMed:12516863, PubMed:9618449). TFIID plays a key role in the regulation of gene expression by RNA polymerase II through different activities such as transcription activator interaction, core promoter recognition and selectivity, TFIIA and TFIIB interaction, chromatin modification (histone acetylation by TAF1), facilitation of DNA opening and initiation of transcription (PubMed:10788514, PubMed:12138208, PubMed:12516863, PubMed:9618449). TFIIF is essential for the initiation of transcription by RNA polymerase II (PubMed:10788514, PubMed:12138208, PubMed:12516863, PubMed:9618449). TFIIF functions include the recruitment of RNA polymerase II to the promoter bound DNA-TBP-TFIIB complex, decreasing the affinity of RNA polymerase II for non-specific DNA, allowing for the subsequent recruitment of TFIIE and TFIIH, and facilitating RNA polymerase II elongation (PubMed:10788514, PubMed:12138208, PubMed:12516863, PubMed:9618449).

Recognizes and binds histone H3 acetylated or crotonylated at 'Lys-9' (H3K9ac and H3K9cr, respectively) (PubMed:26341557, PubMed:27089029). Component of the SWI/SNF complex, an ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeling complex, is required for the positive and negative regulation of gene expression of a large number of genes (PubMed:12672490).

NPC components, collectively referred to as nucleoporins (NUPs), can play the role of both NPC structural components and of docking or interaction partners for transiently associated nuclear transport factors. Active directional transport is assured by both, a Phe-Gly (FG) repeat affinity gradient for these transport factors across the NPC and a transport cofactor concentration gradient across the nuclear envelope (GSP1 and GSP2 GTPases associated predominantly with GTP in the nucleus, with GDP in the cytoplasm). As one of the FG repeat nucleoporins NUP2 is involved in interactions with and guidance of nuclear transport receptors such as SRP1-KAP95 (importin alpha and beta) through the NPC. Like the closely related NUP1 it also plays an important role in disassembling and recycling SRP1-KAP95 to the cytoplasm after nuclear import. Upon entry of the heterotrimeric SRP1-KAP95-cargo complex in the nucleus, NUP2 binds through its N-terminus to the SRP1 nuclear localization signal (NLS) binding site, thus accelerating the release of the NLS-cargo. SRP1 in turn is released from NUP2 by binding of the GSP1-GTP associated export factor CSE1. NUP2 may also have a chromatin boundary/insulator activity through indirect interaction with genomic DNA via CSE1 and blocking of heterochromatin spreading. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11046143, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11387327, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11425876, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11535617, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11867631, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12062099, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12372823, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12543930, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12604785, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12917401, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14514698, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15039779}."

The DASH complex mediates the formation and maintenance of bipolar kinetochore-microtubule attachments by forming closed rings around spindle microtubules and establishing interactions with proteins from the central kinetochore. The DASH ring complex may both stabilize microtubules during chromosome attachment in anaphase A, and allow the chromosome to remain attached to the depolymerizing microtubule in anaphase B. Microtubule depolymerization proceeds by protofilament splaying and induces the kinetochore-attached ring to slide longitudinally, thereby helping to transduce depolymerization energy into pulling forces to disjoin chromatids. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15664196, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16415853, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16777964, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9817759}."
