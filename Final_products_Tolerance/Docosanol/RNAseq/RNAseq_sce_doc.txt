Polyubiquitin chains, when attached to a target protein, have different functions depending on the Lys residue of the ubiquitin that is linked: Lys-6-linked may be involved in DNA repair; Lys-11-linked is involved in ERAD (endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation) and in cell-cycle regulation; Lys-29-linked is involved in lysosomal degradation; Lys-33-linked is involved in kinase modification; Lys-48-linked is involved in protein degradation via the proteasome; Lys-63-linked is involved in endocytosis, and DNA-damage responses.

Most of the produced acetaldehyde is subsequently reduced to ethanol, but some is required for cytosolic acetyl-CoA production for biosynthetic pathways. The enzyme is also one of five 2-oxo acid decarboxylases (PDC1, PDC5, PDC6, ARO10, and THI3) able to decarboxylate more complex 2-oxo acids (alpha-ketoacids) than pyruvate, which seem mainly involved in amino acid catabolism. Here the enzyme catalyzes the decarboxylation of amino acids, which, in a first step, have been transaminated to the corresponding 2-oxo acids. In a third step, the resulting aldehydes are reduced to alcohols, collectively referred to as fusel oils or alcohols. Its preferred substrates are the transaminated amino acids derived from threonine (2-oxobutanoate), norvaline (2-oxopentanoate), valine (3-methyl-2-oxobutanoate, also alpha-keto-isovalerate), isoleucine ((3S)-3-methyl-2-oxopentanoate, also alpha-keto-beta-methylvalerate), phenylalanine (phenylpyruvate), and tryptophan (3-(indol-3-yl)pyruvate), whereas transaminated leucine is no substrate. In a side-reaction the carbanionic intermediate (or active aldehyde) generated by decarboxylation or by activation of an aldehyde can react with an aldehyde via condensation (or carboligation) yielding a 2-hydroxy ketone, collectively called acyloins. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10231381, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10234824, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10753893, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11141278, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12499363, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12902239, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22904058, ECO:0000269|PubMed:4687392, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8866484, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9341119, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9748245}."

Stimulates folding by interacting with nascent chains, binding to short, largely hydrophobic sequences exposed by unfolded proteins, thereby stabilizing longer, more slowly translated, and aggregation-prone nascent polypeptides and domains that cannot fold stably until fully synthesized. The Hsp70-protein substrate interaction depends on ATP-binding and on allosteric regulation between the NBD and the SBD. The ATP-bound state is characterized by a fast exchange rate of substrate (low affinity state), while in the ADP-bound state exchange is much slower (high affinity state). During the Hsp70 cycle, the chaperone switches between the ATP-bound state (open conformation) and the ADP-bound state (closed conformation) by major conformational rearrangements involving mainly the lid domain. Ssb cooperates with a specific Hsp40/Hsp70 co-chaperone termed the ribosome-associated complex (RAC), which stimulates the ATPase activity of the ribosome-associated pool of Ssbs and switches it to the high affinity substrate binding state.

The polymerase activity is proposed to involve a tethering mechanism at the microtubule plus end: a curved, longitudinally microtubule lattice-associated tubulin heterodimer (that cannot be incorporated into the microtubule lattice) is bound via one TOG domain while the other TOG domain binds to an unpolymerized tubulin heterodimer leading to lateral association of these tubulin heterdimers; polymerization-induced straightening of the tubulin heterodimer releases the polymerase (PubMed:11309422, PubMed:25172511, PubMed:16567500, PubMed:25097237).

Here the enzyme catalyzes the decarboxylation of amino acids, which, in a first step, have been transaminated to the corresponding 2-oxo acids. In a third step, the resulting aldehydes are reduced to alcohols, collectively referred to as fusel oils or alcohols. Its preferred substrates are the transaminated amino acids derived from threonine (2-oxobutanoate), norvaline (2-oxopentanoate), valine (3-methyl-2-oxobutanoate, also alpha-keto-isovalerate), isoleucine ((3S)-3-methyl-2-oxopentanoate, also alpha-keto-beta-methylvalerate), phenylalanine (phenylpyruvate), and tryptophan (3-(indol-3-yl)pyruvate), whereas transaminated leucine is no substrate. In a side-reaction the carbanionic intermediate (or active aldehyde) generated by decarboxylation or by activation of an aldehyde can react with an aldehyde via condensation (or carboligation) yielding a 2-hydroxy ketone, collectively called acyloins. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10231381, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10234824, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10338141, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10753893, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11141278, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12499363, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12902239, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22904058, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9341119, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9748245}."

It recognizes H3K4me. SAGA is involved in RNA polymerase II-dependent transcriptional regulation of approximately 10% of yeast genes. At the promoters, SAGA is required for recruitment of the basal transcription machinery. It influences RNA polymerase II transcriptional activity through different activities such as TBP interaction (SPT3, SPT8 and SPT20) and promoter selectivity, interaction with transcription activators (GCN5, ADA2, ADA3 and TRA1), and chromatin modification through histone acetylation (GCN5) and deubiquitination (UBP8). SAGA acetylates nucleosomal histone H3 to some extent (to form H3K9ac, H3K14ac, H3K18ac and H3K23ac). SAGA interacts with DNA via upstream activating sequences (UASs). SLIK is proposed to have partly overlapping functions with SAGA. It preferentially acetylates methylated histone H3, at least after activation at the GAL1-10 locus. Acts in opposition to the FACT complex in regulating polymerase II transcription.

The Hsp70-protein substrate interaction depends on ATP-binding and on allosteric regulation between the NBD and the SBD. The ATP-bound state is characterized by a fast exchange rate of substrate (low affinity state), while in the ADP-bound state exchange is much slower (high affinity state).

Introduces a single-strand break via transesterification at a target site in duplex DNA. The scissile phosphodiester is attacked by the catalytic tyrosine of the enzyme, resulting in the formation of a DNA-(5'-phosphotyrosyl)-enzyme intermediate and the expulsion of a 3'-OH DNA strand. The free DNA strand than undergoes passage around the unbroken strand thus removing DNA supercoils. Finally, in the religation step, the DNA 3'-OH attacks the covalent intermediate to expel the active-site tyrosine and restore the DNA phosphodiester backbone (By similarity). Essential for proper chromosome segregation in both meiosis and mitosis. Weakly relaxes negative supercoils and displays a distinct preference for binding single-stranded DNA. The TOP3-SGS1 protein complex may function as a eukaryotic reverse gyrase introducing positive supercoils into extrachromosomal ribosomal DNA rings. {ECO:0000250, ECO:0000269|PubMed:2546682}."

Essential for vegetative growth. Functions as a component of the transcription regulatory histone acetylation (HAT) complexes SAGA, SALSA and SLIK. SAGA is involved in RNA polymerase II-dependent transcriptional regulation of approximately 10% of yeast genes. At the promoters, SAGA is required for recruitment of the basal transcription machinery. It influences RNA polymerase II transcriptional activity through different activities such as TBP interaction (SPT3, SPT8 and SPT20) and promoter selectivity, interaction with transcription activators (GCN5, ADA2, ADA3 and TRA1), and chromatin modification through histone acetylation (GCN5) and deubiquitination (UBP8). SAGA acetylates nucleosomal histone H3 to some extent (to form H3K9ac, H3K14ac, H3K18ac and H3K23ac). SAGA interacts with DNA via upstream activating sequences (UASs). SALSA, an altered form of SAGA, may be involved in positive transcriptional regulation. SLIK is proposed to have partly overlapping functions with SAGA.

Largest and catalytic component of RNA polymerase II which synthesizes mRNA precursors and many functional non-coding RNAs. Forms the polymerase active center together with the second largest subunit. Pol II is the central component of the basal RNA polymerase II transcription machinery. During a transcription cycle, Pol II, general transcription factors and the Mediator complex assemble as the preinitiation complex (PIC) at the promoter. 11-15 base pairs of DNA surrounding the transcription start site are melted and the single-stranded DNA template strand of the promoter is positioned deeply within the central active site cleft of Pol II to form the open complex. After synthesis of about 30 bases of RNA, Pol II releases its contacts with the core promoter and the rest of the transcription machinery (promoter clearance) and enters the stage of transcription elongation in which it moves on the template as the transcript elongates. Pol II appears to oscillate between inactive and active conformations at each step of nucleotide addition. Elongation is influenced by the phosphorylation status of the C-terminal domain (CTD) of Pol II largest subunit (RPB1), which serves as a platform for assembly of factors that regulate transcription initiation, elongation, termination and mRNA processing. Pol II is composed of mobile elements that move relative to each other. The core element with the central large cleft comprises RPB3, RBP10, RPB11, RPB12 and regions of RPB1 and RPB2 forming the active center. The clamp element (portions of RPB1, RPB2 and RPB3) is connected to the core through a set of flexible switches and moves to open and close the cleft. A bridging helix emanates from RPB1 and crosses the cleft near the catalytic site and is thought to promote translocation of Pol II by acting as a ratchet that moves the RNA-DNA hybrid through the active site by switching from straight to bent conformations at each step of nucleotide addition. In elongating Pol II, the lid loop (RPB1) appears to act as a wedge to drive apart the DNA and RNA strands at the upstream end of the transcription bubble and guide the RNA strand toward the RNA exit groove located near the base of the largely unstructured CTD domain of RPB1. The rudder loop (RPB1) interacts with single-stranded DNA after separation from the RNA strand, likely preventing reassociation with the exiting RNA. The cleft is surrounded by jaws: an upper jaw formed by portions of RBP1, RPB2 and RPB9, and a lower jaw, formed by RPB5 and portions of RBP1. The jaws are thought to grab the incoming DNA template, mainly by RPB5 direct contacts to DNA."

Its predominant cargo substrate seems to be ribosomal proteins and ribosome biogenesis trans- and cis-acting factors (PubMed:9182759, PubMed:9321403, PubMed:15367670). Required for nuclear transport of YAP1, NOP1 and SOF1 (PubMed:11274141, PubMed:15367670). Mediates the nuclear import of histones H3 and H4 (PubMed:11694505). Mediates docking of the importin/substrate complex to the nuclear pore complex (NPC) through binding to repeat-containing nucleoporins. The complex is subsequently translocated through the pore by an energy requiring, Ran-dependent mechanism (PubMed:11423015). At the nucleoplasmic side of the NPC, GTP-Ran binding leads to release of the cargo (PubMed:9321403). The importin is re-exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm where GTP hydrolysis releases Ran from importin. The directionality of nuclear import is thought to be conferred by an asymmetric distribution of the GTP- and GDP-bound forms of Ran between the cytoplasm and nucleus (PubMed:11423015). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11274141, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11694505, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15367670, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9182759, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9321403, ECO:0000305|PubMed:11423015}.; FUNCTION: Plays a role in protein secretion. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:1522152}."

First, a [2Fe-2S] cluster is transiently assembled on the scaffold proteins ISU1 and ISU2. In a second step, the cluster is released from ISU1/ISU2, transferred to glutaredoxin GRX5, followed by the formation of mitochondrial [2Fe-2S] proteins, the synthesis of [4Fe-4S] clusters and their target-specific insertion into the recipient apoproteins. Cluster assembly on ISU1/ISU2 depends on the function of the cysteine desulfurase complex NFS1-ISD11, which serves as the sulfur donor for cluster synthesis, the iron-binding protein frataxin (YFH1) as the putative iron donor, and the electron transfer chain comprised of ferredoxin reductase ARH1 and ferredoxin YAH1, which receive their electrons from NADH. Fe-S cluster release from ISU1/ISU2 is achieved by interaction with the Hsp70 chaperone SSQ1, assisted by the DnaJ-like co-chaperone JAC1 and the nucleotide exchange factor MGE1. ISU1 is the major isoform in yeast, while ISU2 is not detectable in cells grown to stationary phase (By similarity).

In the cytoplasm, the RNA exosome complex is involved in general mRNA turnover and in RNA surveillance pathways, preventing translation of aberrant mRNAs. The catalytic inactive RNA exosome core complex of 9 subunits (Exo-9) is proposed to play a pivotal role in the binding and presentation of RNA for ribonucleolysis, and to serve as a scaffold for the association with catalytic subunits and accessory proteins or complexes. DIS3 has both 3'-5' exonuclease and endonuclease activities. The exonuclease activity of DIS3 is down-regulated upon association with Exo-9 possibly involving a conformational change in the catalytic domain and threading of the RNA substrate through the complex central channel. Structured substrates can be degraded if they have a 3' single-stranded extension sufficiently long (such as 35 nt poly(A)) to span the proposed complex inner RNA-binding path and to reach the exonuclease site provided by DIS3. Plays a role in mitotic control. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:17173052, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8896453, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9390555}."

Appears to be an important mediator of the multiple roles of the poly(A) tail in mRNA biogenesis, stability and translation. In the nucleus, interacts with the nuclear cleavage factor IA (CFIA), which is required for both mRNA cleavage and polyadenylation. Is also required for efficient mRNA export to the cytoplasm. Acts in concert with a poly(A)-specific nuclease (PAN) to affect poly(A) tail shortening, which may occur concomitantly with either nucleocytoplasmic mRNA transport or translational initiation. Regulates PAN activity via interaction with the stimulator PAN3 or the inhibitor PBP1. In the cytoplasm, affects both translation and mRNA decay. Stimulates translation by interaction with translation initiation factor eIF4G, a subunit of the cap-binding complex eIF4F, bringing the 5'- and 3'-ends of the mRNA in proximity. The formation of this circular mRNP structure appears to be critical for the synergistic effects of the cap and the poly(A) tail in facilitating translation initiation, recycling of ribosomes, and mRNA stability. Also regulates translation termination by recruiting eukaryotic release factor 3 (eRF3). Interaction with eRF3 is also required for regulation of normal mRNA decay through translation termination-coupled poly(A) shortening, probably mediated by PAN.

It has been reported to function both as a (target membrane) t-SNARE and as a (vesicle) v-SNARE. Upon vesicle tethering to the target membrane, which requires additional proteins, a SNARE-pin is formed. This is a very stable 4 parallel alpha-helical coil bundle consisting of 4 SNARE domains (usually one of each type: Qa, Qb, Qc, and R), of which at least one is anchored in the opposite membrane. The formation of the SNARE-pin is believed to bring the two membranes in close proximity and to provide the energy to drive membrane fusion. Through its interaction with the VFT (or GARP) complex, it may also contribute to vesicle recognition specificity and tethering.

Heterodimerizes with MSH2 to form MutS alpha, which binds to DNA mismatches thereby initiating DNA repair. MSH6 provides substrate-binding and substrate specificity to the complex. When bound, MutS alpha bends the DNA helix and shields approximately 20 base pairs. Acts mainly to repair base-base and single insertion-deletion mismatches that occur during replication, but can also repair longer insertion-deletion loops (IDLs), although with decreasing efficiency as the size of the extrahelical loop increases. After mismatch binding, forms a ternary complex with the MutL alpha heterodimer, which is thought to be responsible for directing the downstream MMR events, including strand discrimination, excision, and resynthesis. ATP binding and hydrolysis by the MutS alpha complex is crucial for MMR. Both subunits bind ATP, but with differing affinities, and their ATPase kinetics are also very different. MSH6 binds and hydrolyzes ATP rapidly, whereas MSH2 catalyzes ATP at a substantially slower rate. Binding to a mismatched base pair suppresses MSH6-catalyzed ATP hydrolysis, but not the activity of MSH2. ATP binding to both subunits is necessary to trigger a change in MutS alpha interaction with mismatched DNA, converting MutS alpha into a sliding clamp capable of hydrolysis-independent movement along DNA, and also facilitates formation of ternary complexes containing MutS and MutL proteins and the mismatch. May also be involved in resolution of recombination intermediates. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10518225, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10970737, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11237611, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12509278, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12820877, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15811858, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16214425, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16337600, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16407100, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16600868, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16702432, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17141577, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17157869, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17567610, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17573527, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8600025, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9111357, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9545323, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9770499}."

Forms two different heterodimers: MutS alpha (MSH2-MSH6 heterodimer) and MutS beta (MSH2-MSH3 heterodimer), which bind to DNA mismatches thereby initiating DNA repair. MSH2 seems to act as a scaffold for the other MutS homologs that provide substrate-binding and substrate specificity. When bound, heterodimers bend the DNA helix and shield approximately 20 base pairs. MutS alpha acts mainly to repair base-base and single insertion-deletion mismatches that occur during replication, but can also repair longer insertion-deletion loops (IDLs), although with decreasing efficiency as the size of the extrahelical loop increases. MutS beta acts mainly to repair IDLs from 2 to 13 nucleotides in size, but can also repair base-base and single insertion-deletion mismatches. After mismatch binding, MutS alpha or beta form a ternary complex with a MutL heterodimer, which is thought to be responsible for directing the downstream MMR events, including strand discrimination, excision, and resynthesis. ATP binding and hydrolysis play a pivotal role in mismatch repair functions. Both subunits bind ATP, but with differing affinities, and their ATPase kinetics are also very different. MSH6 binds and hydrolyzes ATP rapidly, whereas MSH2 catalyzes ATP at a substantially slower rate. Binding to a mismatched base pair suppresses MSH6-catalyzed ATP hydrolysis, but not the activity of MSH2. ATP binding to both subunits is necessary to trigger a change in MutS alpha interaction with mismatched DNA, converting MutS alpha into a sliding clamp capable of hydrolysis-independent movement along DNA, and also facilitates formation of ternary complexes containing MutS and MutL proteins and the mismatch. MutS beta also has a role in regulation of heteroduplex formation during mitotic and meiotic recombination. MutS beta binds to DNA flap structures predicted to form during recombination, and is required for 3' non-homologous tail removal (NHTR). MutS beta-binding alters the DNA conformation of its substrate at the ds/ssDNA junction and may facilitate its recognition and/or cleavage by the downstream nucleotide excision repair (NER) RAD1-RAD10 endonuclease. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10518225, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11237611, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12509278, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12820877, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12875840, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15811858, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16214425, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16337600, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16600868, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16702432, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16781730, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17157869, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17636021, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8600025, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9111357, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9256462, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9368761, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9545323, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9770499}."

SAGA is involved in RNA polymerase II-dependent transcriptional regulation of approximately 10% of yeast genes. At the promoters, SAGA is required for recruitment of the basal transcription machinery. It influences RNA polymerase II transcriptional activity through different activities such as TBP interaction (SPT3, SPT8 and SPT20) and promoter selectivity, interaction with transcription activators (GCN5, ADA2, ADA3 and TRA1), and chromatin modification through histone acetylation (GCN5) and deubiquitination (UBP8). SAGA acetylates nucleosomal histone H3 to some extent (to form H3K9ac, H3K14ac, H3K18ac and H3K23ac). SAGA interacts with DNA via upstream activating sequences (UASs). SALSA, an altered form of SAGA, may be involved in positive transcriptional regulation. SLIK is proposed to have partly overlapping functions with SAGA. It preferentially acetylates methylated histone H3, at least after activation at the GAL1-10 locus. HFI1/ADA1 and SPT20/ADA5 may recruit TATA binding protein (TBP) and possibly other basal factors to bind to the TATA box. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10026213}."

Active directional transport is assured by both, a Phe-Gly (FG) repeat affinity gradient for these transport factors across the NPC and a transport cofactor concentration gradient across the nuclear envelope (GSP1 and GSP2 GTPases associated predominantly with GTP in the nucleus, with GDP in the cytoplasm). As one of the FG repeat nucleoporins NUP2 is involved in interactions with and guidance of nuclear transport receptors such as SRP1-KAP95 (importin alpha and beta) through the NPC. Like the closely related NUP1 it also plays an important role in disassembling and recycling SRP1-KAP95 to the cytoplasm after nuclear import. Upon entry of the heterotrimeric SRP1-KAP95-cargo complex in the nucleus, NUP2 binds through its N-terminus to the SRP1 nuclear localization signal (NLS) binding site, thus accelerating the release of the NLS-cargo. SRP1 in turn is released from NUP2 by binding of the GSP1-GTP associated export factor CSE1. NUP2 may also have a chromatin boundary/insulator activity through indirect interaction with genomic DNA via CSE1 and blocking of heterochromatin spreading. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11046143, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11387327, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11425876, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11535617, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11867631, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12062099, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12372823, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12543930, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12604785, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12917401, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14514698, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15039779}."

The functional states of the translocon complex include co- and post-translational ER import, cotranslational membrane protein integration and retrograde transport of misfolded proteins out of the ER. In the cotranslational pathway, ribosomes synthesizing presecretory proteins are targeted to the translocon by the cytosolic signal recognition particle (SRP) and its ER-localized receptor. The association of the Sec61 complex with the ribosome is mediated by the 28S rRNA of the large ribosomal subunit. SRP-independent post-translational translocation requires the association of additional factors, such as the Sec62/63 complex and KAR2. Also part of the Ssh1 complex, which probably is the major component of a channel-forming translocon complex that may function exclusively in the cotranslational pathway of protein ER import."

Most of the produced acetaldehyde is subsequently reduced to ethanol, but some is required for cytosolic acetyl-CoA production for biosynthetic pathways. The enzyme is also one of five 2-oxo acid decarboxylases (PDC1, PDC5, PDC6, ARO10, and THI3) able to decarboxylate more complex 2-oxo acids (alpha-keto-acids) than pyruvate, which seem mainly involved in amino acid catabolism. Here the enzyme catalyzes the decarboxylation of amino acids, which, in a first step, have been transaminated to the corresponding 2-oxo acids. In a third step, the resulting aldehydes are reduced to alcohols, collectively referred to as fusel oils or alcohols. Its preferred substrates are the transaminated amino acids derived from threonine (2-oxobutanoate), norvaline (2-oxopentanoate), valine (3-methyl-2-oxobutanoate, also alpha-keto-isovalerate), isoleucine ((3S)-3-methyl-2-oxopentanoate, also alpha-keto-beta-methylvalerate), phenylalanine (phenylpyruvate), and tryptophan (3-(indol-3-yl)pyruvate), whereas transaminated leucine is no substrate. In a side-reaction the carbanionic intermediate (or active aldehyde) generated by decarboxylation or by activation of an aldehyde can react with an aldehyde via condensation (or carboligation) yielding a 2-hydroxy ketone, collectively called acyloins. The expression level of this protein in the presence of fermentable carbon sources is so low that it cannot compensate for the other two pyruvate decarboxylases to sustain fermentation. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10234824, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10753893, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11141278, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12499363, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12902239, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22904058, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9341119, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9748245}."

Binding of TFIID to a promoter (with or without TATA element) is the initial step in preinitiation complex (PIC) formation. TFIID plays a key role in the regulation of gene expression by RNA polymerase II through different activities such as transcription activator interaction, core promoter recognition and selectivity, TFIIA and TFIIB interaction, chromatin modification (histone acetylation by TAF1), facilitation of DNA opening and initiation of transcription. SAGA is involved in RNA polymerase II-dependent transcriptional regulation of approximately 10% of yeast genes. At the promoters, SAGA is required for recruitment of the basal transcription machinery. It influences RNA polymerase II transcriptional activity through different activities such as TBP interaction (SPT3, SPT8 and SPT20) and promoter selectivity, interaction with transcription activators (GCN5, ADA2, ADA3 and TRA1), and chromatin modification through histone acetylation (GCN5) and deubiquitination (UBP8). SAGA acetylates nucleosomal histone H3 to some extent (to form H3K9ac, H3K14ac, H3K18ac and H3K23ac). SAGA interacts with DNA via upstream activating sequences (UASs). SALSA, an altered form of SAGA, may be involved in positive transcriptional regulation. SLIK is proposed to have partly overlapping functions with SAGA.

Heterodimerizes with MSH2 to form MutS beta, which binds to DNA mismatches thereby initiating DNA repair. MSH3 provides substrate-binding and substrate specificity to the complex. When bound, the MutS beta heterodimer bends the DNA helix and shields approximately 20 base pairs. Acts mainly to repair insertion-deletion loops (IDLs) from 2 to 13 nucleotides in size, but can also repair base-base and single insertion-deletion mismatches that occur during replication. After mismatch binding, forms a ternary complex with either the MutL alpha or MutL beta heterodimer, which is thought to be responsible for directing the downstream MMR events, including strand discrimination, excision, and resynthesis. MutS beta also has a role in regulation of heteroduplex formation during mitotic and meiotic recombination. MutS beta binds to DNA flap structures predicted to form during recombination, and is required for 3' non-homologous tail removal (NHTR). MutS beta-binding alters the DNA conformation of its substrate at the ds/ssDNA junction and may facilitate its recognition and/or cleavage by the downstream nucleotide excision repair (NER) RAD1-RAD10 endonuclease.

Preferentially interacts with tRNAs with mature 5'- and 3'-termini and does not distinguish between intron-containing and spliced tRNAs. In the nucleus binds to tRNA and to the Ran-GTPases GSP1 or GSP2 in their active GTP-bound form. Docking of this trimeric complex to the nuclear pore complex (NPC) is mediated through binding to nucleoporins. Upon transit of a nuclear export complex into the cytoplasm, disassembling of the complex and hydrolysis of Ran-GTP to Ran-GDP cause release of the tRNA from the export receptor. The directionality of nuclear export is thought to be conferred by an asymmetric distribution of the GTP- and GDP-bound forms of Ran between the cytoplasm and nucleus. Involved in pre-tRNA splicing, probably by affecting the interaction of pre-tRNA with splicing endonuclease. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10713174, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10727409, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10766739, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14640976, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15905365, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16040803, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17203074, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18045534, ECO:0000269|PubMed:3031485, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7363329, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8366091, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8641292, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8725220, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9774653, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9802895, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9971735}."

As a reconfigurer of centromeric and flanking nucleosomes, RSC complex is required both for proper kinetochore function in chromosome segregation and, via a PKC1-dependent signaling pathway, for organization of the cellular cytoskeleton. This subunit is involved in transcriptional regulation. Heterodimer of ARP9 and ARP7 functions with HMG box proteins to facilitate proper chromatin architecture. Heterodimer formation is necessary for assembly into RSC complex. Part of the SWI/SNF complex, an ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complex, is required for the positive and negative regulation of gene expression of a large number of genes.

Binding of alpha-factor or a-factor to its cognate transmembrane receptor STE2 and STE3, respectively, allows the receptor to serve as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) on GPA1. The exchange of GDP for GTP on the G protein alpha subunit alters its interaction with the G protein beta subunit STE4, leading to dissociation of the G protein beta-gamma dimer STE4-STE18. The dissociated subunits activate downstream effectors to activate the mating response pathway and induce changes necessary to produce mating-competent cells. STE4-STE18 activate the downstream pheromone signaling MAP kinase cascade leading to expression of mating-specific genes, inducing cell cycle arrest in G1, promoting polarized cell growth to form mating projections (shmoos), and establishing the changes in plasma membrane, cell wall and nuclear envelope to permit cell-cell fusion (plasmogamy) and fusion of the two haploid nuclei (karyogamy). GPA1 transmits a signal that requires direct binding to the effector enzyme PI3K located at the endosome, promoting increased PI3 production. The intrinsic GTPase activity of GPA1 determines the duration of signaling, and is dramatically accelerated by the RGS protein SST2. In unstimulated cells, GDP-bound GPA1 sequesters the G protein beta-gamma subunit STE4-STE18, preventing it from activating the downstream effectors. Also down-regulates the signal by inhibiting the pheromone-induced accumulation of FUS3 in the nucleus. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10356642, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12029138, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12556475, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12960402, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14536090, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15519996, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16839886, ECO:0000269|PubMed:1900495, ECO:0000269|PubMed:2105453, ECO:0000269|PubMed:2107073, ECO:0000269|PubMed:2117698, ECO:0000269|PubMed:2161538, ECO:0000269|PubMed:2494429, ECO:0000269|PubMed:2548076, ECO:0000269|PubMed:2644047, ECO:0000269|PubMed:3113738, ECO:0000269|PubMed:3136318, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8231812, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8887662, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9537998}."

TORC1 regulates multiple cellular processes to control cell growth in response to environmental signals. Nutrient limitation and environmental stress signals cause inactivation of TORC1. Active TORC1 positively controls ribosome biogenesis via control of rRNA, ribosomal protein and tRNA gene expression, and rRNA processing. TORC1 positively controls protein biosynthesis by regulation of mRNA stability, translation initiation factor activity, and high-affinity amino acid permeases that serve to provide amino acids for use by the translation machinery. TORC1 also promotes growth by sequestering a number of nutrient and general stress-responsive transcription factors in the cytoplasm. TORC1 negatively controls macroautophagy, a process to recycle surplus cytoplasmic mass under nutrient starvation conditions. LST8 is involved in the negative regulation of transcription factors GLN3 and RTG1-RTG3, limiting the synthesis of alpha-ketoglutarate, glutamate and glutamine. LST8 is required for targeting of amino acid permeases (AAPs) to the plasma membrane. TORC2 regulates cell cycle-dependent polarization of the actin-cytoskeleton, cell wall integrity, and receptor endocytosis. TORC2 controls polarity of the actin cytoskeleton, which is required for orienting the secretory pathway toward discrete growth sites, via the RHO1/PKC1/MAPK cell integrity pathway. LST8 is involved in maintenance of cell wall integrity. LST8 modulates TOR2 kinase activity. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11742997, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12719473, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9409822}."

Acetylation of histones gives a specific tag for epigenetic transcription activation. Operates in concert with certain DNA-binding transcriptional activators such as GCN4 or HAP2/3/4. Its acetyltransferase activity seems to be dependent on the association in different multisubunit complexes. Functions as histone acetyltransferase component of the transcription regulatory histone acetylation (HAT) complexes SAGA, SALSA and ADA. SAGA is involved in RNA polymerase II-dependent transcriptional regulation of approximately 10% of yeast genes. At the promoters, SAGA is required for recruitment of the basal transcription machinery. It influences RNA polymerase II transcriptional activity through different activities such as TBP interaction (SPT3, SPT8 and SPT20) and promoter selectivity, interaction with transcription activators (GCN5, ADA2, ADA3 and TRA1), and chromatin modification through histone acetylation (GCN5) and deubiquitination (UBP8). SAGA acetylates nucleosomal histone H3 to some extent (to form H3K9ac, H3K14ac, H3K18ac and H3K23ac). SAGA interacts with DNA via upstream activating sequences (UASs). SALSA, an altered form of SAGA, may be involved in positive transcriptional regulation. The ADA histone acetyltransferase complex preferentially acetylates nucleosomal histones H3 (to form H3K14ac and H3K18ac) and H2B, leading to transcription regulation. SLIK is proposed to have partly overlapping functions with SAGA. It preferentially acetylates methylated histone H3, at least after activation at the GAL1-10 locus. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10026213, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16543222, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16543223}."

Microtubule depolymerization proceeds by protofilament splaying and induces the kinetochore-attached ring to slide longitudinally, thereby helping to transduce depolymerization energy into pulling forces to disjoin chromatids. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11698664, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11724818, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15664196, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16415853, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16777964, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9817759}."

SAGA is involved in RNA polymerase II-dependent transcriptional regulation of approximately 10% of yeast genes. At the promoters, SAGA is required for recruitment of the basal transcription machinery. It influences RNA polymerase II transcriptional activity through different activities such as TBP interaction (SPT3, SPT8 and SPT20) and promoter selectivity, interaction with transcription activators (GCN5, ADA2, ADA3 and TRA1), and chromatin modification through histone acetylation (GCN5) and deubiquitination (UBP8). SAGA acetylates nucleosomal histone H3 to some extent (to form H3K9ac, H3K14ac, H3K18ac and H3K23ac). SAGA interacts with DNA via upstream activating sequences (UASs). SLIK is proposed to have partly overlapping functions with SAGA. It preferentially acetylates methylated histone H3, at least after activation at the GAL1-10 locus.

The APC/C is thought to confer substrate specificity and, in the presence of ubiquitin-conjugating E2 enzymes, it catalyzes the formation of protein-ubiquitin conjugates that are subsequently degraded by the 26S proteasome. In early mitosis, the APC/C is activated by CDC20 and targets securin PDS1, the B-type cyclin CLB5, and other anaphase inhibitory proteins for proteolysis, thereby triggering the separation of sister chromatids at the metaphase-to-anaphase transition. In late mitosis and in G1, degradation of CLB5 allows activation of the APC/C by CDH1, which is needed to destroy CDC20 and the B-type cyclin CLB2 to allow exit from mitosis and creating the low CDK state necessary for cytokinesis and for reforming prereplicative complexes in G1 prior to another round of replication. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10871279, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12928868, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15060174, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7925276, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9660930}."

Binding of TFIID to a promoter (with or without TATA element) is the initial step in preinitiation complex (PIC) formation. TFIID plays a key role in the regulation of gene expression by RNA polymerase II through different activities such as transcription activator interaction, core promoter recognition and selectivity, TFIIA and TFIIB interaction, chromatin modification (histone acetylation by TAF1), facilitation of DNA opening and initiation of transcription. SAGA is involved in RNA polymerase II-dependent transcriptional regulation of approximately 10% of yeast genes. At the promoters, SAGA is required for recruitment of the basal transcription machinery. It influences RNA polymerase II transcriptional activity through different activities such as TBP interaction (SPT3, SPT8 and SPT20) and promoter selectivity, interaction with transcription activators (GCN5, ADA2, ADA3 and TRA1), and chromatin modification through histone acetylation (GCN5) and deubiquitination (UBP8). SAGA acetylates nucleosomal histone H3 to some extent (to form H3K9ac, H3K14ac, H3K18ac and H3K23ac). SAGA interacts with DNA via upstream activating sequences (UASs). SALSA, an altered form of SAGA, may be involved in positive transcriptional regulation. SLIK is proposed to have partly overlapping functions with SAGA. It preferentially acetylates methylated histone H3, at least after activation at the GAL1-10 locus. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10026213, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10788514, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12052880, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12138208, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12516863, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9674426}."

SAGA is involved in RNA polymerase II-dependent transcriptional regulation of approximately 10% of yeast genes. At the promoters, SAGA is required for recruitment of the basal transcription machinery. It influences RNA polymerase II transcriptional activity through different activities such as TBP interaction (SPT3, SPT8 and SPT20) and promoter selectivity, interaction with transcription activators (GCN5, ADA2, ADA3 and TRA1), and chromatin modification through histone acetylation (GCN5) and deubiquitination (UBP8). SAGA acetylates nucleosomal histone H3 to some extent (to form H3K9ac, H3K14ac, H3K18ac and H3K23ac). SAGA interacts with DNA via upstream activating sequences (UASs). SALSA, an altered form of SAGA, may be involved in positive transcriptional regulation. SPT3 is required for recruitment of TATA-binding protein (TBP) to SAGA-dependent promoters. During SAGA-mediated transcriptional inhibition, SPT3 and SPT8 prevent binding of TBP to the TATA box. SLIK is proposed to have partly overlapping functions with SAGA. It preferentially acetylates methylated histone H3, at least after activation at the GAL1-10 locus. SPT factors 3, 7 and 8 are required for the initiation of Ty transcription from the delta promoter.

It is one of 5 proteins constituting the COPII coat, which is involved in anterograde (ER to Golgi) double-membrane transport vesicle formation. First the small GTPase SAR1, activated by and binding to the integral ER membrane protein SEC12, exchanges GDP for GTP and recruits the heterodimer SEC23/24, which in turn recruits the heterotetramer SEC13-SEC31. The polymerization of COPII coat complexes then causes physically the deformation (budding) of the membrane, leading to the creation of a transport vesicle. The COPII complex is dissociated upon SAR1-GTP hydrolysis to SAR1-GDP. SEC23 functions as the SAR1 GTPase activating protein, whose activity is stimulated in the presence of SEC13/31. SEC13 is directly or indirectly required for normal ER membrane and nuclear envelope morphology. It also functions as a component of the nuclear pore complex (NPC). NPC components, collectively referred to as nucleoporins (NUPs), can play the role of both NPC structural components and of docking or interaction partners for transiently associated nuclear transport factors. SEC13 is required for efficient mRNA export from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and for correct nuclear pore biogenesis and distribution.

TFIID plays a key role in the regulation of gene expression by RNA polymerase II through different activities such as transcription activator interaction, core promoter recognition and selectivity, TFIIA and TFIIB interaction, chromatin modification (histone acetylation by TAF1), facilitation of DNA opening and initiation of transcription. SAGA is involved in RNA polymerase II-dependent transcriptional regulation of approximately 10% of yeast genes. At the promoters, SAGA is required for recruitment of the basal transcription machinery. It influences RNA polymerase II transcriptional activity through different activities such as TBP interaction (SPT3, SPT8 and SPT20) and promoter selectivity, interaction with transcription activators (GCN5, ADA2, ADA3 and TRA1), and chromatin modification through histone acetylation (GCN5) and deubiquitination (UBP8).

The induction of some of these genes requires the cooperative action of both, YAP1 and SKN7. Preferentially binds to promoters with the core binding site 5'-TTA[CG]TAA-3'. Activity of the transcription factor is controlled through oxidation of specific cysteine residues resulting in the alteration of its subcellular location. Oxidative stress (as well as carbon stress, but not increased temperature, acidic pH, or ionic stress) induces nuclear accumulation and as a result YAP1 transcriptional activity. Activation by hydrogen peroxide or thiol-reactive chemicals elicit distinct adaptive gene responses. Nuclear export is restored when disulfide bonds are reduced by thioredoxin (TRX2), whose expression is controlled by YAP1, providing a mechanism for negative autoregulation.

SAGA is involved in RNA polymerase II-dependent transcriptional regulation of approximately 10% of yeast genes. At the promoters, SAGA is required for recruitment of the basal transcription machinery. It influences RNA polymerase II transcriptional activity through different activities such as TBP interaction (SPT3, SPT8 and SPT20) and promoter selectivity, interaction with transcription activators (GCN5, ADA2, ADA3 and TRA1), and chromatin modification through histone acetylation (GCN5) and deubiquitination (UBP8). SAGA acetylates nucleosomal histone H3 to some extent (to form H3K9ac, H3K14ac, H3K18ac and H3K23ac). SAGA interacts with DNA via upstream activating sequences (UASs). SALSA, an altered form of SAGA, may be involved in positive transcriptional regulation. SLIK is proposed to have partly overlapping functions with SAGA.

Cluster assembly on ISU1/ISU2 depends on the function of the cysteine desulfurase complex NFS1-ISD11, which serves as the sulfur donor for cluster synthesis, the iron-binding protein frataxin (YFH1) as the putative iron donor, and the electron transfer chain comprised of ferredoxin reductase ARH1 and ferredoxin YAH1, which receive their electrons from NADH.

ISU1 is the major isoform in yeast, while ISU2 is not detectable in cells grown to stationary phase (PubMed:10588895, PubMed:12970193, PubMed:14741370, PubMed:15123690, PubMed:16341089, PubMed:16431909, PubMed:23615440, PubMed:25358379). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10588895, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12970193, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14741370, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15123690, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16341089, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16431909, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23615440, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25358379}."

The Mediator complex dissociates from the RNA polymerase II holoenzyme and stays at the promoter when transcriptional elongation begins. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11555651, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16076843, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16263706}."

SAGA is involved in RNA polymerase II-dependent transcriptional regulation of approximately 10% of yeast genes. At the promoters, SAGA is required for recruitment of the basal transcription machinery. It influences RNA polymerase II transcriptional activity through different activities such as TBP interaction (SPT3, SPT8 and SPT20) and promoter selectivity, interaction with transcription activators (GCN5, ADA2, ADA3 and TRA1), and chromatin modification through histone acetylation (GCN5) and deubiquitination (UBP8). SAGA acetylates nucleosomal histone H3 to some extent (to form H3K9ac, H3K14ac, H3K18ac and H3K23ac). SAGA interacts with DNA via upstream activating sequences (UASs). SALSA an altered form of SAGA, may be involved in positive transcriptional regulation. SLIK is proposed to have partly overlapping functions with SAGA.

Binding of TFIID to a promoter (with or without TATA element) is the initial step in preinitiation complex (PIC) formation. TFIID plays a key role in the regulation of gene expression by RNA polymerase II through different activities such as transcription activator interaction, core promoter recognition and selectivity, TFIIA and TFIIB interaction, chromatin modification (histone acetylation by TAF1), facilitation of DNA opening and initiation of transcription. SAGA is involved in RNA polymerase II-dependent transcriptional regulation of approximately 10% of yeast genes. At the promoters, SAGA is required for recruitment of the basal transcription machinery. It influences RNA polymerase II transcriptional activity through different activities such as TBP interaction (SPT3, SPT8 and SPT20) and promoter selectivity, interaction with transcription activators (GCN5, ADA2, ADA3 and TRA1), and chromatin modification through histone acetylation (GCN5) and deubiquitination (UBP8). SAGA acetylates nucleosomal histone H3 to some extent (to form H3K9ac, H3K14ac, H3K18ac and H3K23ac). SAGA interacts with DNA via upstream activating sequences (UASs). SALSA, an altered form of SAGA, may be involved in positive transcriptional regulation. SLIK is proposed to have partly overlapping functions with SAGA. It preferentially acetylates methylated histone H3, at least after activation at the GAL1-10 locus. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10026213, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10788514, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11238921, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11295558, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11473260, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12052880, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12138208, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12516863, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9674426, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9695952}."

The Mediator complex unfolds to an extended conformation and partially surrounds RNA polymerase II, specifically interacting with the unphosphorylated form of the C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II. The Mediator complex dissociates from the RNA polymerase II holoenzyme and stays at the promoter when transcriptional elongation begins. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:16076843, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16109375, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16263706}."

Binding of TFIID to a promoter (with or without TATA element) is the initial step in preinitiation complex (PIC) formation. TFIID plays a key role in the regulation of gene expression by RNA polymerase II through different activities such as transcription activator interaction, core promoter recognition and selectivity, TFIIA and TFIIB interaction, chromatin modification (histone acetylation by TAF1), facilitation of DNA opening and initiation of transcription. SAGA is involved in RNA polymerase II-dependent transcriptional regulation of approximately 10% of yeast genes. At the promoters, SAGA is required for recruitment of the basal transcription machinery. It influences RNA polymerase II transcriptional activity through different activities such as TBP interaction (SPT3, SPT8 and SPT20) and promoter selectivity, interaction with transcription activators (GCN5, ADA2, ADA3, and TRA1), and chromatin modification through histone acetylation (GCN5) and deubiquitination (UBP8). SAGA acetylates nucleosomal histone H3 to some extent (to form H3K9ac, H3K14ac, H3K18ac and H3K23ac). SAGA interacts with DNA via upstream activating sequences (UASs). SLIK is proposed to have partly overlapping functions with SAGA.

Functions as component of the transcription regulatory histone acetylation (HAT) complexes SAGA, SALSA and SLIK. SAGA is involved in RNA polymerase II-dependent transcriptional regulation of approximately 10% of yeast genes. At the promoters, SAGA is required for recruitment of the basal transcription machinery. It influences RNA polymerase II transcriptional activity through different activities such as TBP interaction (SPT3, SPT8 and SPT20) and promoter selectivity, interaction with transcription activators (GCN5, ADA2, ADA3 and TRA1), and chromatin modification through histone acetylation (GCN5) and deubiquitination (UBP8). SAGA acetylates nucleosomal histone H3 to some extent (to form H3K9ac, H3K14ac, H3K18ac and H3K23ac). SAGA interacts with DNA via upstream activating sequences (UASs). SALSA, an altered form of SAGA, may be involved in positive transcriptional regulation. SLIK is proposed to have partly overlapping functions with SAGA.

ATG8 delipidation by ATG4 also recycles ATG8-PE generated on inappropriate membranes to maintain a reservoir of unlipidated ATG8 that is required for autophagosome formation at the PAS. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11038174, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11100732, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11149920, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11904149, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16680092, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17632063, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18701704, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18725539, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22240591, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22652539, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8050581, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8224160, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9649430}."

The sequential action of ESCRT-0, -I, and -II together with the ordered assembly of ESCRT-III links membrane invagination to cargo sorting (PubMed:12194857). Membrane scission in the neck of the growing vesicle releases mature, cargo-laden ILVs into the lumen (PubMed:24139821, PubMed:24711499). ESCRT-III is critical for late steps in MVB sorting, such as membrane invagination and final cargo sorting and recruitment of late-acting components of the sorting machinery (PubMed:24139821, PubMed:24711499). SNF7 is the most abundant ESCRT-III subunit which forms membrane-sculpting filaments with 30 Angstrom periodicity and a exposed cationic membrane-binding surface (PubMed:26670543). Its activation requires a prominent conformational rearrangement to expose protein-membrane and protein-protein interfaces (PubMed:26670543). SNF7 filaments then form spirals that could function as spiral springs (PubMed:26522593). The elastic expansion of compressed SNF7 spirals generates an area difference between the two sides of the membrane and thus curvature which could be the origin of membrane deformation leading eventually to fission (PubMed:26522593). SNF7 recruits BRO1, which in turn recruits DOA4, which deubiquitinates cargos before their enclosure within MVB vesicles (PubMed:11029042, PubMed:15935782). ESCRT-III is also recruited to the nuclear envelope (NE) by integral INM proteins to surveil and clear defective nuclear pore complex (NPC) assembly intermediates to ensure the fidelity of NPC assembly (PubMed:25303532). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11559748, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12194857, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15935782, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24139821, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24711499, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25303532, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26522593, ECO:0000269|PubMed:3062374}."

Polyubiquitin chains, when attached to a target protein, have different functions depending on the Lys residue of the ubiquitin that is linked: Lys-6-linked may be involved in DNA repair; Lys-11-linked is involved in ERAD (endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation) and in cell-cycle regulation; Lys-29-linked is involved in lysosomal degradation; Lys-33-linked is involved in kinase modification; Lys-48-linked is involved in protein degradation via the proteasome; Lys-63-linked is involved in endocytosis, and DNA-damage responses. Linear polymer chains formed via attachment by the initiator Met lead to cell signaling.

The nucleotide-free form of the dimer is found in an open conformation in which the N-termini are not dimerized and the complex is ready for client protein binding. Binding of ATP induces large conformational changes, resulting in the formation of a ring-like closed structure in which the N-terminal domains associate intramolecularly with the middle domain and also dimerize with each other, stimulating their intrinsic ATPase activity and acting as a clamp on the substrate. Finally, ATP hydrolysis results in the release of the substrate. This cycle probably induces conformational changes in the client proteins, thereby causing their activation. Interacts dynamically with various co-chaperones that modulate its substrate recognition, ATPase cycle and chaperone function. Required for growth at high temperatures. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:17114002}."
